Build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js that serves data to a frontend
application. The API should have the following features:
1. User registration and login with secure password storage and hashing.
2. CRUD functionality for managing data in a database.
3. The ability to search and filter data based on user-defined parameters.
4. Pagination and sorting of data.
5. Authentication and authorization of requests using JWT tokens.
6. Error handling and logging of API requests and responses.
For the database, you can use any relational or non-relational database such as MySQL,
MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
